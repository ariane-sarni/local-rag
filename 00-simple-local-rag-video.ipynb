       "  'text': 'Menopause  In the middle-aged years, women undergo a specific change that  has a major effect on their health. They begin the process of  menopause, typically in their late forties or early fifties. The ovaries  slowly cease to produce estrogen and progesterone, which results  in the end of menstruation. Menopausal symptoms can vary, but  often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The  hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a  number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in  body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone  loss is another common condition related to menopause due to  the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases  the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to  complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.6  Recommendations for women experiencing menopause or  perimenopause (the stage just prior to the end of the menstruation)  include:  • consuming a variety of whole grains, and other nutrient-dense  foods  • maintaining a diet high in fiber, low in fat, and low in sodium  • avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, and alcohol to help prevent hot  flashes  • eating foods rich in calcium, or taking physician-prescribed  calcium supplements and vitamin D  • doing stretching exercises to improve balance and flexibility  6.

Pregnant women of normal prepregnancy weight should gain  between 25 and 35 pounds in total through the entire pregnancy. The precise amount that a mother should gain usually depends on  her beginning weight or body mass index (BMI).',\n",

       "'Personal Choices  Carbohydrates are in most foods so you have a great variety of  choices with which to meet the carbohydrates recommendations  for a healthy diet.The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars.To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner. • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day.A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta. Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient. • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour. • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette. Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste. • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.'"
