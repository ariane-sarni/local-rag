    "2.  Allows LLM to work with custom data - Since LLMs are already trained with internet scaled data, they have a decent understanding of language in general but because of this their responses can be fairly generic. RAG essentially helps create specific responses based on input documents (i.e. your own companies customer support docs, etc.)\n",
