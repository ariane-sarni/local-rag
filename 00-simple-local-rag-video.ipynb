       "  'text': 'The Pros and Cons of Food Additives  The FDA works to protect the public from potentially dangerous  additives. Passed in 1958, the Food Additives Amendment states that  a manufacturer is responsible for demonstrating the safety of an  additive before it can be approved. The Delaney Clause that was  added to this legislation prohibits the approval of any additive found  to cause cancer in animals or humans. However, most additives  are considered to be “generally recognized as safe,” a status that is  determined by the FDA and referred to as GRAS.  Food additives are typically included in the processing stage to  improve the quality and consistency of a product. Many additives  also make items more “shelf stable,” meaning they will last a lot  longer on store shelves and can generate more profit for store  owners. Additives can also help to prevent spoilage that results from  changes in temperature, damage during distribution, and other  adverse conditions. In addition, food additives can protect  consumers from exposure to rancid products and foodborne  illnesses.  Food  additives  aren’t  always  beneficial,  however.  Some  substances have been associated with certain diseases if consumed  in large amounts. For example, the FDA estimates that sulfites can  cause allergic reactions in 1 percent of the general population and  in 5 percent of asthmatics. Similarly, the additive monosodium  glutamate, which is commonly known as MSG, may cause  headaches, nausea, weakness, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat,  and chest pain in some individuals.3  3.

About 15 seconds into exercise, the stored ATP and creatine  phosphate are used up in the muscles.The heart and lungs have still  not adapted to the increase need of oxygen so the muscles must  begin to produce ATP by anaerobic metabolism (without oxygen). Anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP at a rapid pace but only  uses glucose as its fuel source.The glucose is obtained from the  blood of muscle glycogen.At around 30 seconds, anaerobic  pathways are operating at their full capacity but because the  availability of glucose is limited, it cannot continue for a long period  of time.

Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient. • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour. • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette. Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste. • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.'"

      "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
      "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",

      "Example 2:\n",
      "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
      "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",

      "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
      "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

Keep in mind when evaluating your nutritional intake that  the values established have been devised with an ample  safety margin and should be used as guidance for optimal  intakes.Also, the values are meant to assess and plan  average intake over time; that is, you don’t need to meet  these recommendations every single day—meeting them on  average over several days is sufficient.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used.The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids.When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released.Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion.\n",
      "- percent of the population meets their nutrient need is the EAR, and  the point at which 97 to 98 percent of the population meets their  needs is the RDA.The UL is the highest level at which you can  consume a nutrient without it being too much—as nutrient intake  increases beyond the UL, the risk of health problems resulting from  that nutrient increases.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is the  calculated range of how much energy from carbohydrates, fats,  and protein is recommended for a healthy diet adequate of the  essential nutrients and is associated with a reduced risk of chronic  disease.The ranges listed in Table 12.1 “Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Ranges (AMDR) For Various Age Groups” allows  individuals to personalize their diets taking into consideration that  different subgroups in a population often require different  requirements.The DRI committee recommends using the midpoint  of the AMDRs as an approach to focus on moderation2.\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Water  There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities:  water.Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water.More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water.Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely.On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined.Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4. Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions).In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes).',\n",

The amount of each mineral found in  our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those  minerals.When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health  problems may arise. Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the  diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams.These include  sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and  sulfur.These major minerals can be found in various foods.For  example, in Guam, the major mineral, calcium, is consumed in the  diet not only through dairy, a common source of calcium, but also  through through the mixed dishes, desserts and vegetables that  they consume.',\n",

The foods we eat contain nutrients.Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions.Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them.Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body.These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce.There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health.These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals.Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4  |  Introduction',\n",
